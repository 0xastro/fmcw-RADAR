/* ======================================================================= */
/*      This code requires a special sequence of twiddle factors stored    */
/*      in 1Q15 fixed-point format.  The following C code is used for      */
/*      the natural C and intrinsic C implementations.                     */
/*                                                                         */
/*      In order to vectorize the FFT, it is desirable to access twiddle   */
/*      factor array using double word wide loads and fetch the twiddle    */
/*      factors needed. In order to do this a modified twiddle factor      */
/*      array is created, in which the factors WN/4, WN/2, W3N/4 are       */
/*      arranged to be contiguous. This eliminates the seperation between  */
/*      twiddle factors within a butterfly. However this implies that as   */
/*      the loop is traversed from one stage to another, that we maintain  */
/*      a redundant version of the twiddle factor array. Hence the size    */
/*      of the twiddle factor array increases as compared to the normal    */
/*      Cooley Tukey FFT.  The modified twiddle factor array is of size    */
/*      "2 * N" where the conventional Cooley Tukey FFT is of size"3N/4"   */
/*      where N is the number of complex points to be transformed. The     */
/*      routine that generates the modified twiddle factor array was       */
/*      presented earlier. With the above transformation of the FFT,       */
/*      both the input data and the twiddle factor array can be accessed   */
/*      using double-word wide loads to enable packed data processing.     */
/*                                                                         */
