<div class="textblock"><p>The DPM Module provides a well defined IPC mechanism which allows application and data path processing chains (DPC) to communicate with each other. The applications and DPC could be located on the same subsystem or could be located on different subsystems. The DPM was designed for the following:-</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Modularity The framework provides a clear demarcation between the application code and the data path processing chain.</li>
<li>Simple Intuitive API The framework exposes a set of standard well defined API which allows application developers to load, configure and execute the processing chain</li>
</ol>
<p>Data Path Processing Chain (DPC) can be defined as any execution block which receives input data, processes it and generates an output. Example: The Low Level processing chain can be defined as a a block which receives ADC data and generate a point cloud.</p>
<p>Except the XWR14xx all the other supported platforms have the DSS and MSS subsystem. In most use cases the MSS is defined as a control domain while the DSS actually executes the DPC. The DPM module provides an ability to exchange configuration between the MSS and DSS via the IPC. Application and DPC developers are thus abstracted from this complexity.</p>
<h2>Processing Chain Developers</h2>
<p>The DPM can be used by developers to create their own processing chains in which case please refer to the processing chain exported API </p><dl class="section see"><dt>See also</dt><dd><a class="el" href="group___d_p_m___p_r_o_c_e_s_s_i_n_g___c_h_a_i_n___a_p_i.html" title="The section has a list of all function which need to be populated by a developers writing a custom pr...">DPM Processing Chain API</a></dd></dl>
<h2>Reporting</h2>
<p>Application using the framework need to register a report function which receives status reports from the framework module. This is an important feedback mechanism through which the framework can keep the application informed about the status of operations. For a list of all the reports </p><dl class="section see"><dt>See also</dt><dd><a class="el" href="group___d_p_m___e_x_t_e_r_n_a_l___d_a_t_a___s_t_r_u_c_t_u_r_e.html#ga81b51eda4c065fbdeb4cc8de5697f70c" title="Report Types. ">DPM_Report</a></dd></dl>
<h2>Domains</h2>
<p>The DPM module introduces a concept of domains which identifies the extent to which the Control and Data Path processing chains are distributed</p>
<h3>Local Domains</h3>
<p>In the local domain the control and DPC are executing on the same subsystem.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="local_domain.png" alt="local_domain.png"/>
</div>
<h3>Remote Domains</h3>
<p>In the remote domain the control is executing on one subsystem while the DPC is executing on another subsystem</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="remote_domain.png" alt="remote_domain.png"/>
</div>
<h3>Distributed Domains</h3>
<p>In the distributed domain the control is executing on one subsystem while the DPC is executing on both the subsystems</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="distributed_domain.png" alt="distributed_domain.png"/>
</div>
<h2>Restrictions</h2>
<p>The DPM framework is currently limited to a single remote/distributed domain. Multiple local domains can be instantiated without any issues.</p>
<p>Due to memory consideration, DPM has IPC local queue set to <a class="el" href="group___d_p_m___i_n_t_e_r_n_a_l___d_a_t_a___s_t_r_u_c_t_u_r_e.html#gad0f85dcc86bb0baafde715d65c65189f">DPM_MAX_LOCAL_QUEUE</a>.</p>
<p>In remote/distributed domain setup, messages delivered through report function to MSS/DSS is not serialized. Hence the order (MSS gets it first or DSS gets it first) cannot be guaranteed. </p>
